    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p> 
        Homemade pancakes shouldn’t be complicated. It doesn’t matter if they come out wonky or with 
        a splotchy surface instead of being a beautiful, even golden brown – after all, they’ll get 
        smothered in toppings.<br>But they should be soft and fluffy. And in my world, not too sweet. 
        Because….you know. Toppings. Load up on toppings!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>baking powder</li>
        <li>sugar</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>vanilla extract – optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place flour, baking powder, sugar and salt in a bowl, whisk to combine</li>
        <li>Add egg, milk and vanilla. Whisk until lump free - no longer than 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>THeat a non stick skillet - use medium heat if you have a strong stove, medium high if you have a weak one. </li>
        <li>Pour 1/4 cup batter into the middle of the fry pan (I use a slightly heaped ice cream scoop with lever, standard is 1/4 cup).</li>
        <li>Swirl pan lightly to spread or use the ice cream scoop edge to spread into 11cm / 4.5" circle (ruler is a must) (joking!).</li>
        <li>When bubbles rise to the surface (see video), flip and cook the other side until golden.</li>
        <li>Remove and keep warm in a low oven.</li>
        <li>Use more butter every 2 to 3 pancakes - depends how good your non stick coating is.</li>
        <li>Serve with toppings of choice!</li>
    </ol>
