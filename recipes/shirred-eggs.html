    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p> 
        Baked Eggs can be as simple as cracking eggs into a muffin tin, then popping it in the oven. 
        All good – but, well, kinda humdrum.<br> These shirred eggs though? They’re cooked on a bed 
        of garlicky mushrooms and spinach. We drizzle the eggs with just a touch of cream and give 
        it all a shower of parmesan before popping in the oven. The cream melds with eggs as they 
        bake, yielding bubbling, custardy, runny-yolks-with-set-whites perfection!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Mushrooms</li>
        <li>Spinach</li>
        <li>Garlic, thyme and butter</li>
        <li>Cream and parmesan</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by cooking the mushrooms until golden. Add the garlic towards the end, else it will burn before the mushrooms are done.</li>
        <li>When the mushrooms are done, toss the spinach in and stir just until wilted. This literally takes 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Divide the mushroom mixture between the ramekins.</li>
        <li>Make a shallow crater in the surface of the mushroom mixture so when you rack the eggs in, the yolk settles in the middle.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper, drizzle over cream, then parmesan.</li>
        <li>for 15 minutes at 200°C / 390°F / (180°F fan) for runny yolks and just-set whites. Check at 12 minute mark</li>
        <li>sprinkle with a pinch of smoked paprika (optional) or even cayenne if you like it hot (definitely optional!), chives (optional), and with hot crusty bread for dunking (not optional!).</li>
    </ol>
